Why not? We acquire a reference within the RCU critical section, and if 
we have that reference we're obviously safe against concurrent frees, 
because the refcount is not zero (so it's invalid to free the object).

If css_tryget fails, the refcount was already zero and the css is about 
to be freed, in which case this does nothing. (Your initial fixup 
dropped another reference in that case, which is invalid as it pretty 
much guarantees a refcount underflow.)

What's "many different" issues? I'm aware of your testing showing one 
potential issue, which is that dmem.min protection may evict own cgroups 
instead of others' cgroups. I didn't do anything about that in this 
series because I think it's a pre-existing issue that I'm fairly sure is 
at least theoretically triggerable without my patchset.

Are there any other issues I missed?
