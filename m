Since dmem_cgroup_pool_state_put() also puts a css reference but get_cg_pool_unlocked does not get another reference to the css on its own?

Well, I meant that I was not sure about it. As my version did it under the
RCU lock, I wanted to concede my past self some benefit of the doubt, but I
could not reason about it while I was writing down this email. At least
under my tests back then, I did not notice any issues, but I will revisit
it and I even noticed that get_cg_pool_unlocked takes the RCU lock, so this
seems to be fine from a first look. As you pointed out, we have already
picked the css ref under the RCU lock.

Well, for one, there is:

[ 1285.795196] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[ 1285.795239] percpu ref (css_release) <= 0 (-13) after switching to atomic
[ 1285.795244] WARNING: lib/percpu-refcount.c:197 at percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic_rcu+0x22f/0x280, CPU#4: ksoftirqd/4/31
[...]
[ 1285.799577] percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic_rcu: percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic_rcu(): percpu_ref underflow slab kmalloc-64 start ffff889279463dc0 pointer offset 0 size 64

Which I now would attribute to this unconditional css_put. As I pointed
out, dmem_cgroup_pool_state_put already puts it (which is why we also
needed to get it in the first place).

And, then, I am seeing hung tasks and kmemleaks, which could be the result
of the failing VRAM allocations for VM BOs from a quick read of the stack.
