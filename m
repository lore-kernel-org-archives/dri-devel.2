Hi Michal,

Thanks for taking a look.

No, that was not what I meant to imply. The commit message was not precise
enough there.

The intended normal retry is only for the case where the GFP_NOWAIT
allocation under dmemcg_lock fails. In that case, get_cg_pool_unlocked()
drops the lock, preallocates one pool with GFP_KERNEL, and the next locked
retry consumes that preallocated pool and clears allocpool.

So allocpool != NULL together with another -ENOMEM return is not expected to
be a normal retry path. The WARN_ON(allocpool) branch looks defensive, and I
agree that repeatedly continuing from there would not be useful if it ever
fired.

callers' ability to handle ERR_PTR().

The first allocation attempt happens in alloc_pool_single() while
dmemcg_lock is held, so it uses GFP_NOWAIT. If that fails,
get_cg_pool_unlocked() drops the lock and preallocates one pool with the
default GFP_KERNEL context. The next locked retry then consumes that
preallocated pool instead of trying another GFP_NOWAIT allocation for that
pool.

So callers can handle the final ERR_PTR() result, but the fallback
preallocation gives the allocation a chance to succeed in a less
constrained context before reporting -ENOMEM. That said, whether this
retry policy is desirable is a dmem design question, so input from dmem
folks would be helpful.

Agreed. 

Since Tejun has already applied the fix, I will wait for the discussion
before sending any follow-up. If we keep the current retry scheme, a small
cleanup can make this path clearer.

Thanks,
Guopeng
