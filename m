Since dmem_cgroup_pool_state_put() also puts a css reference but get_cg_pool_unlocked does not get another reference to the css on its own?

I wrote the fixup at [1] that included that css_put. I will look into the
possibility of get_cg_pool_unlocked returning NULL or error. But I find
that unconditionally calling css_put here is wrong. If pool is NULL, it
needs to be called, because otherwise the css_tryget will be unbalanced.

The reason not to call it unconditionally is that it will be called when
dmem_cgroup_pool_state_put is caled, hence, balancing the css_tryget.

I also need to consider whether doing it outside the RCU section is fine.

I just looked here and one of the possibilities for pool to be NULL is that
the region is unregistered in a race condition. region->unregistered is
protected by dmemcg_lock, but that is taken by get_cg_pool_unlocked, so it
seems possible.

By the way, while testing the whole series, I see many different issues
here that I am still looking at as they may be otherwise hidden
pre-existing bugs.

Regards.
Cascardo.
